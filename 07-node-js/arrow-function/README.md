# Arrow Function

## Movie Queue Script

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript object manipulation.
- Arrow functions vs regular function expressions.
- Array methods like `pop()`, `unshift()`, and `length`.
- Working with `this` in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to properly bind `this` in JavaScript objects.
- Learn to manage a movie queue using object methods.
- Differentiate between arrow functions and regular function expressions and how they affect `this`.
- Practice using array manipulation methods within an object context.

## Features

- **funnyCase**: Converts a string so that each letter is the opposite case from the one before.
- **map**: Custom implementation of the `map()` method to modify an array.
- **filter**: Custom implementation of the `filter()` method to remove elements from an array based on a condition.
- **netflixQueue**: An object that allows adding, removing, and printing movies from a movie queue:
  - **addMovie**: Adds a movie to the front of the queue.
  - **watchMovie**: Removes the last movie from the queue.
  - **printQueue**: Prints the current movie queue in a numbered list.

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to manage a Netflix-style movie queue using an object in JavaScript. It covers important concepts like object method creation, binding `this`, and array manipulation techniques. By converting arrow functions to regular function expressions, we ensure that `this` correctly references the object within the methods. The project also reinforces understanding of fundamental JavaScript array methods and their use within an object context.
