# Command-line Argument Comparison in Node.js

## Concepts Covered

- **Command-line Arguments**: Utilizing `process.argv` in Node.js to capture arguments from the command line.
- **Variable Assignment**: Assigning command-line arguments to variables in a Node.js script.
- **Conditional Comparison**: Comparing two variables to check if they hold the same value and logging the result to the console.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to access command-line arguments in Node.js using `process.argv`.
- Understand how to assign command-line arguments to variables.
- Practice comparing two values and logging results in a Node.js environment.

## Features

- **Command-line Input**: Users can pass two arguments from the command line for comparison.
- **Equality Check**: The program compares two arguments and logs `true` if they are equal or `false` if they are not.
- **Flexible Input**: The script accepts any two values for comparison, making it reusable for multiple cases.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the use of `process.argv` in Node.js to handle command-line arguments. The script compares two input values and returns whether they are equal. This is a fundamental exercise in working with command-line inputs and conditional statements in Node.js.
