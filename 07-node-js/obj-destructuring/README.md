# Object and Array Destructuring in JavaScript

## Concepts Covered

- **Object Destructuring**: Extracting specific properties from an object into variables in a concise and readable manner.
- **Nested Object Destructuring**: Accessing properties from deeply nested objects efficiently.
- **Array Destructuring**: Extracting values from an array into variables with a clean syntax.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to destructure objects to pull out specific properties into variables.
- Learn how to handle destructuring with nested objects.
- Grasp the concept of array destructuring and how to assign values to specific variables.

## Features

- **Object Destructuring**: Destructure properties from a simple object to use them directly in your code.
- **Nested Object Destructuring**: Extract values from deeply nested objects to access only the required properties.
- **Array Destructuring**: Break down arrays into individual variables for better code readability and usage.

## Summary

This exercise focuses on destructuring objects and arrays in JavaScript. Object destructuring allows for easy extraction of object properties into variables, while array destructuring provides a simple way to assign array values to variables. Nested object destructuring is also covered, allowing developers to handle complex structures more efficiently.
