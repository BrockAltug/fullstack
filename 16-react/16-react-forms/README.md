## Key Features

1. **State Management**:
   - Utilizes React's `useState` hook for dynamic state updates.

2. **Props Handling**:
   - Passes data between components using React props for reusability and flexibility.

3. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Implements input validation and error messages for enhanced user experience.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Leverages React's event handling to manage user interactions like form submissions and button clicks.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Styled with Bootstrap or CSS for a mobile-friendly and visually appealing layout.
