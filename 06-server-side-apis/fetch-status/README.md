## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to fetch data from an API using the `fetch` method in JavaScript.
- Understand how to check and handle different HTTP response statuses (e.g., 200, 404).
- Display response status information dynamically on a webpage.
- Practice debugging and logging API request results to the console.

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and handle various HTTP response statuses in JavaScript. The `getApi` function requests data from the provided URL (`badRequestUrl`) and checks the response status. Depending on the status code, it dynamically displays the result on the webpage, which helps in understanding how to manage different outcomes of API requests.
