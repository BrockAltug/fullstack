## Summary

simple JavaScript application that fetches user data from the GitHub API and dynamically displays it on the webpage. By clicking the "Fetch" button, users can see the usernames and URLs of the first five GitHub users retrieved from the API. This project helps in understanding how to handle API requests, manipulate the DOM, and use asynchronous JavaScript functions.
