## Summary

Clean and responsive layout using CSS Flexbox. The layout utilizes `display: flex` and `flex-wrap` to ensure that elements automatically move to the next line if they donâ€™t fit on the screen, preserving a consistent design. Additionally, the images within the layout are constrained with a `min-width` of 400px, ensuring they remain clear and appropriately sized regardless of the device.
