## Custom Forms with CSS: Linking and Key Concepts

## Concepts Covered

- **HTML Structure and Semantics**

  - Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including the use of `<head>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` elements.
  - Structuring content with semantic elements to improve accessibility and maintainability.
  - Using `<form>` elements to create interactive forms, including text inputs, text areas, checkboxes, and dropdown menus.

- **CSS Reset and Custom Styling**

  - Implementing a CSS reset (`reset.css`) to ensure consistent styling across all browsers, removing default margins, paddings, and styles.
  - Creating custom styles (`style.css`) to enhance the appearance of the webpage, including layout adjustments, typography settings, and form styling.
  - Linking CSS files in the correct order to ensure resets are applied before custom styles.

- **CSS Properties and Selectors**

  - Utilizing various CSS properties such as `display`, `flex`, `margin`, `padding`, `font-size`, `color`, and `background` to create a visually appealing layout.
  - Applying pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:placeholder-shown` to create dynamic styles that respond to user actions.
  - Using pseudo-elements like `::after` to insert additional content dynamically, enhancing user interaction and feedback.

- **UI/UX Design Principles**
  - Enhancing readability and accessibility through font size adjustments, color choices, and spacing.
  - Improving user interaction with hover effects, tooltips, and dynamic content visibility.
  - Implementing responsive design with media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
