# Table Setup

## Concepts Covered

- SQL Database Management
- Database Creation and Deletion
- Table Creation with Primary Keys
- Data Integrity through Column Constraints

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to create and manage SQL databases.
2. Learn how to safely delete existing databases and tables.
3. Practice defining tables with specified columns and primary keys.
4. Ensure data integrity by applying constraints such as `NOT NULL`.

## Features

- **Database Creation**: Creates a new database named `books_db` for storing information related to books.
- **Safe Database Management**: Includes commands to drop the existing database if it exists, preventing errors during setup.
- **Table Definition**: Creates a `biographies` table with an `id` column set as the primary key and a `name` column for storing biography names.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures the `name` column cannot be empty by setting it as `NOT NULL`, maintaining consistent data entry.

## Summary

This setup for the `books_db` database demonstrates fundamental SQL database management tasks, including creating and deleting databases, defining tables with primary keys, and enforcing data integrity using constraints. It provides a basic yet essential foundation for managing structured data within SQL, ensuring reliability and consistency throughout the data management process.
