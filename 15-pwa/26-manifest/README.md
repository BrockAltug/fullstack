# PWA Manifest

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to configure a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a manifest file using Webpack and additional plugins. The PWA manifest ensures that the app can be installed on devices and provides metadata like the app name, theme color, and icons.

## Key Features

1. **PWA Manifest Configuration**:

   - Adds a manifest file to the PWA for metadata like app name, theme color, and icons.
   - Uses the `WebpackPwaManifest` plugin to generate the manifest.

2. **Webpack Plugins**:

   - `HtmlWebpackPlugin` for generating the HTML file.
   - `GenerateSW` from Workbox for creating a service worker.
   - `WebpackPwaManifest` for generating the PWA manifest file.

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Integrates service workers using Workbox for offline functionality.
