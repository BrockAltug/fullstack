# Event-Listener

# Counter Application

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript event listeners for handling button clicks.
- DOM manipulation to update content dynamically.
- Basic conditional logic to prevent invalid operations (e.g., negative counts).

## Learning Objectives

- Implement and understand event listeners in JavaScript.
- Dynamically update the content of a web page based on user interactions.
- Apply conditional statements to control the flow of a program.

## Features

- **Increment and Decrement Buttons:** The application features two buttons: one to increment the counter and another to decrement it.
- **Counter Display:** The current value of the counter is displayed on the page and updates in real-time as the buttons are clicked.
- **Prevent Negative Count:** The decrement button is equipped with logic to prevent the counter from going below zero.

## Summary

Simple counter application that demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling user interactions and dynamically updating the content of a webpage. It is a basic example of event-driven programming and real-time data manipulation on a web page.
