# Scope

## Variable Scope and Function Accessibility

## Concepts Covered

- Declaring variables in the appropriate scope for function access.
- Using local and global scopes to control variable availability.
- Understanding the difference between `const`, `let`, and variable declaration placement.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn to declare variables globally or locally depending on where they need to be accessed within the code.
- Practice refactoring code to ensure variables are available to multiple functions without unnecessary redeclaration.
- Understand how to use block-level scoping (`let` and `const`) to maintain clean and efficient code structure.
