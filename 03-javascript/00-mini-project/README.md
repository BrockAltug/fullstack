# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Concepts Covered

- Implementing a basic game loop with user input in JavaScript
- Using conditional statements to handle game logic and determine the winner
- Keeping track of game statistics, such as wins, losses, ties, and user choices
- Utilizing built-in JavaScript methods like `prompt` and `confirm` for user interaction

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to use a `while` loop to create a continuous game loop that interacts with the user.
- Understand how to handle user input, validate it, and ensure the input is in the expected format.
- Practice using random number generation (`Math.random`) to simulate computer choices.
- Learn how to use alert messages and prompts to guide user interaction in a game.

## Features

- **Game Loop**: Implements a loop that allows the user to repeatedly play the game until they choose to stop.
- **User Input Handling**: Asks the user for their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), validates the input, and normalizes the letter casing.
- **Computer Choice Simulation**: Generates a random choice for the computer using `Math.random`.
- **Score Tracking**: Maintains a count of wins, losses, ties, and the number of times each option (Rock, Paper, Scissors) was chosen by the user.
- **Play-Again Option**: Asks the user if they want to play again and continues the game loop if they agree.

## Summary

This module provides a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript. It covers user input handling, game logic for determining the winner, and score tracking. The code demonstrates how to create a continuous game loop with interactive prompts and alerts, making it an excellent example of building a basic game with JavaScript.
