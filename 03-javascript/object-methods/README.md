## Concepts Covered

- Working with objects, arrays, and functions in JavaScript.
- Accessing object properties and methods correctly.
- Debugging code to ensure proper execution and output.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to access and call methods within an object.
- Learn how to check for the presence of a value within an array using `includes`.
