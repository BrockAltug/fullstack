## JavaScript Equality Comparison Functions

Create functions that log specific messages based on whether the values are equal in type and/or value. It also covers how to rewrite a function as a function expression.

## Concepts Covered

- **Function Declaration:** Creating a function using the `function` keyword and understanding how it operates within the scope.
- **Strict Equality (`===`):** Comparing two values to check if they are equal in both type and value.
- **Loose Equality (`==`):** Comparing two values to check if they are equal in value, allowing type coercion.
- **Conditional Statements:** Using `if-else` statements to perform different actions based on the result of the equality checks.
- **Function Expression:** Rewriting a function as a function expression and understanding the differences from a function declaration.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to implement and use functions in JavaScript to compare values.
- Learn the difference between strict equality (`===`) and loose equality (`==`) operators.
- Gain experience with conditional logic to handle different comparison outcomes.
- Practice rewriting a function declaration as a function expression and calling both types of functions.
