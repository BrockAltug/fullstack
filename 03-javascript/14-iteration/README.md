## Greeting Classmates with JavaScript Loops

Demonstrates how to store and manipulate an array of strings in JavaScript. It includes logging the number of elements in an array and iterating over the array using different types of loops to display personalized greetings.

## Concepts Covered

- **Array Creation:** Initializing an array with predefined elements, in this case, the names of classmates.
- **Array Length Property:** Using the `.length` property to determine and log the number of elements in an array.
- **For Loop:** Iterating over an array using a traditional `for` loop to access each element and log a customized message.
- **For-Of Loop:** Utilizing a `for-of` loop to iterate over the elements of an array in a more concise manner.

## Learning Objectives
