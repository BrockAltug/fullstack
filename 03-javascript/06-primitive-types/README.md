# Primitive-Types

## JavaScript Type Checking

Demonstrates how to check and log the data types of various variables using the `typeof` operator in JavaScript.

## Concepts Covered

- **Primitive Data Types**: Understanding different data types in JavaScript, including `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Understanding that JavaScript variables can change their data types during runtime.
- **Type Checking**: Using the `typeof` operator to determine the type of a variable.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and understand the different primitive data types in JavaScript.
- Practice checking the type of a variable using the `typeof` operator.
- Observe how variables in JavaScript can change types and how `typeof` reflects these changes.
