# Custom Helpers with Handlebars and Express.js

## Concepts Covered

- Using custom helpers with Handlebars in an Express.js application
- Formatting data for display in templates
- Enhancing template functionality with reusable helper functions

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to create and use custom Handlebars helpers to manipulate and format data.
2. Learn how to format dates or other information for improved readability in the template.
3. Practice enhancing Handlebars templates by injecting custom helper functions.

## Overview

### Template Structure

This template displays details of a painting, including an image, title, artist, and exhibition date. The structure of the template organizes each painting's data for easy readability and accessibility.

### Using Custom Helpers

To improve readability and provide a consistent format, custom Handlebars helpers are used to process and display data. For instance, a custom helper can format the `exhibition_date` so it appears in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Exhibition open until: January 31, 2023").

#### Key Custom Helper Functions:

- **Date Formatting**: Custom helpers can format dates into a more readable form, such as converting `YYYY-MM-DD` format to a longer format, like "Month Day, Year".
- **Conditional Display**: Helpers can also be used to apply conditional logic, such as checking if an exhibition is ongoing, closed, or opening soon, and displaying messages accordingly.

### Custom Helper Benefits

Using custom helpers with Handlebars provides several advantages:

- **Reusability**: Helpers can be used across different templates, ensuring consistent formatting and behavior.
- **Improved Readability**: Date formatting and other enhancements improve readability and user experience within the application.
- **Code Simplification**: By moving logic to helpers, templates remain cleaner and more focused on display rather than data manipulation.

## Summary

This guide demonstrates how to use custom helpers in Handlebars with Express.js to enhance templates by formatting data, such as dates. Custom helpers enable dynamic, readable, and reusable templates, making them an essential tool for effective front-end templating in web applications.
