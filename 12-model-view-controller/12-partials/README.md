# Handlebars Partials in MVC Architecture

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Handlebars partials in an MVC architecture to dynamically render reusable components. It highlights the use of partial templates for displaying individual elements within a larger view, such as painting details in a gallery.

---

## Key Features

1. **Reusable Handlebars Partials**:

   - Implements partial templates for rendering individual painting cards, enabling code reuse and consistency.

2. **Dynamic Rendering**:

   - Uses `{{#each}}` loops to iterate through data and render components dynamically.

3. **MVC Architecture**:

   - Applies the Model-View-Controller design pattern, separating data, logic, and presentation layers.

4. **Interactive Components**:

   - Dynamically generated links allow users to navigate to detailed views of individual paintings.

5. **Data Binding**:
   - Leverages Handlebars helpers to bind data to templates and display it dynamically.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Handlebars Partials**:

   - Learn how to create reusable components using partial templates.

2. **Dynamic Data Binding**:

   - Use Handlebars expressions to bind and render data dynamically.

3. **Iterating with `{{#each}}`**:

   - Explore looping through arrays of data and rendering components for each item.

4. **MVC Architecture**:

   - Understand the separation of concerns, with templates focusing on the view layer.

5. **Dynamic Links**:
   - Create links dynamically based on data attributes, such as painting IDs.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Run `npm install` to set up the project and install required packages.

2. **Run the Application**:

   - Start the application using:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **View the Application**:
   - Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to explore the dynamically rendered galleries and paintings.

## Expected Behavior

1. The gallery view displays a list of paintings using the `painting-details` partial for each painting.
2. Each painting card links to its detailed page, dynamically generated based on the painting's ID.
3. Images, titles, artist names, and descriptions are displayed dynamically for each painting.

## Summary

This project highlights the use of Handlebars partials to build reusable and maintainable templates within an MVC framework. It demonstrates best practices for separating concerns and dynamically rendering data in a scalable application.
