## Summary

This project implements a simple shopping list application where users can add items to their list by submitting a form. Upon submission, the value from the form input is added to the list and displayed on the page as a new list item. The input field is then cleared, allowing users to quickly add another item. This is achieved using jQuery for event handling and DOM manipulation.
