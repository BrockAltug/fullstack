# Google-Fonts

## Guestbook Application

## Concepts Covered

- Customizing fonts using Google Fonts.
- Overriding Bootstrap's default fonts for body text and headings.
- Applying custom styling while maintaining Bootstrap's responsive layout.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to load and apply fonts from Google Fonts to replace default Bootstrap fonts.
- Understand how to target and style different text elements (e.g., body text and headings) using CSS.
- Maintain Bootstrap's responsiveness while applying custom styles for a unique look.

## Features

- **Custom Fonts for Body Text**: The page’s body text uses a font loaded from Google Fonts instead of Bootstrap’s default font.
- **Custom Fonts for Headings**: All headings on the page use a different font, also loaded from Google Fonts, to create a unique design.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout remains responsive, using Bootstrap’s grid system and components, while allowing custom font styling.

## Customization Details

- **Google Fonts Integration**: The page uses the `Karla` and `Rubik` fonts, loaded from Google Fonts. The fonts are applied as follows:
  - **Karla** for body text, giving the page a modern and clean look.
  - **Rubik** for headings, adding emphasis and boldness to the titles and sections.
- **Custom CSS**: The fonts are applied using custom CSS that overrides Bootstrap’s default typography. This ensures the page maintains a distinct style while preserving Bootstrap’s layout.

## Summary

This project is a guestbook application with a focus on custom fonts and design. The page’s body text and headings use fonts loaded from Google Fonts, replacing Bootstrap's default fonts to create a more personalized and visually appealing interface. The custom fonts provide a unique aesthetic while the layout remains responsive thanks to Bootstrap’s grid system. This project highlights how to integrate Google Fonts into a Bootstrap-based project for a fully customized design.
