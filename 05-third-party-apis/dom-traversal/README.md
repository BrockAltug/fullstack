# Dom-Traversal

## jQuery Tic Tac Toe - DOM Manipulation

## Concepts Covered

- DOM traversal and manipulation using jQuery
- Dynamic updates to game board elements
- Efficient jQuery selectors for better readability

## Learning Objectives

- Ensure that DOM elements are fully rendered before performing any manipulations.
- Use jQuery to select, traverse, and manipulate DOM elements effectively.
- Understand how to select specific elements based on their position and update their content programmatically.

## Features

- On page load, all boxes on the Tic Tac Toe board are styled with a white background.
- The third row is selected and updated programmatically.
- The first box in the third row is modified to display the character 'O' to make a game move.

## Summary

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation techniques using jQuery within a Tic Tac Toe game. The game board is updated by selecting and traversing the DOM elements, starting from the root element `<main id="root">`. The background color of each box is changed to white, and the first box in the third row is dynamically updated to display the 'O' character. The code utilizes segmented traversal for better readability when manipulating specific elements in a multi-level structure like the game board.
