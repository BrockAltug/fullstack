# Classes

## BlogPost and Comment Class Implementation

## Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class Constructors
- Methods in Classes
- Array Manipulation
- Console Logging

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create and work with class constructors.
- Learn how to add methods to class constructors.
- Use methods to manipulate object properties, such as adding comments to a blog post.
- Practice working with arrays in an object context.
- Get familiar with handling dynamic input like dates and user-provided data.

## Features

- **BlogPost Class**: This class represents a blog post with properties like `authorName`, `title`, `text`, `comments`, and `createdOn`. It includes methods to print metadata and add comments.
- **Comment Class**: This class represents a comment with properties like `authorName`, `text`, and `createdOn`. It includes a method to print metadata.
- **Dynamic Methods**:
  - `printMetaData()`: Outputs metadata about the blog post or comment.
  - `addComment()`: Adds a comment to the blog post's comments array.
- **Objects**: Create new `BlogPost` and `Comment` objects and interact with them using their respective methods.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the creation of class constructors with methods and properties, focusing on building a simple system for blog posts and comments. Using JavaScript, this exercise covers core OOP principles such as encapsulation, method invocation, and object manipulation.
