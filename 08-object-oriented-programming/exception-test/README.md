# BlogPost Author Validation and Testing

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript Class Construction
- Regular Expressions for Input Validation
- Error Handling in JavaScript
- Writing Unit Tests with Jest for Robust Code Verification

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to implement input validation using regex patterns within JavaScript classes.
2. Learn to handle errors effectively when validating user input.
3. Practice writing unit tests to ensure class constructors behave as expected.
4. Develop skills in using Jest to verify error conditions and valid inputs, supporting a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

## Features

- **Author Name Validation**: The `BlogPost` class checks the provided author name for specific criteria, including minimum length and allowed characters.
- **Regular Expression Utilization**: Regex ensures author names contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs, ensuring robust and user-friendly validation.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Includes tests to verify that the `BlogPost` class throws errors for invalid inputs and accepts valid ones, promoting code reliability.

## Summary

The BlogPost Author Validation and Testing project demonstrates best practices in input validation using regular expressions and error handling within JavaScript classes. By employing a test-driven development approach, the project ensures that only valid author names are accepted, providing clear error messages when conditions are not met. Through unit tests, it reinforces the importance of validation and error handling in creating secure, reliable software.
