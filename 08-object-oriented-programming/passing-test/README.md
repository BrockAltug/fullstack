# Password Validation and Testing

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript Class Implementation
- Regular Expressions for String Validation
- Writing Unit Tests with Jest
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to implement password validation using regex patterns in JavaScript.
2. Learn how to write unit tests to validate different cases and scenarios.
3. Practice creating classes and methods that encapsulate specific functionalities.
4. Develop skills in using Jest to ensure code reliability through comprehensive testing.

## Features

- **Password Validation**: The `isPassword()` method checks if a password meets specific criteria, including length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, and inclusion of at least one number.
- **Regular Expression Utilization**: Uses regex to efficiently verify password conditions.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Includes multiple test cases to ensure the password validation works as expected under various scenarios.
- **Test-Driven Development**: The project demonstrates a TDD approach, starting from writing tests to ensure functionality and then implementing the code to pass those tests.

## Summary

This Password Validation and Testing project showcases how to implement and validate strong password requirements using JavaScript. By applying a test-driven development approach, the project ensures robustness and reliability, covering various scenarios through unit tests. It emphasizes the importance of writing secure and efficient code, along with the value of testing in modern software development.
