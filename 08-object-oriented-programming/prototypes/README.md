# BlogPost Constructor with Comments Feature

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript Constructor Functions
- Using `.prototype` to extend object methods
- Working with arrays to manage comments

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create a constructor function and use `.prototype` for method declarations.
- Learn how to extend functionality to all instances of an object using prototypes.
- Practice adding and managing comments on blog posts using JavaScript arrays.

## Features

- A `BlogPost` constructor function that initializes properties such as `authorName`, `title`, `text`, `createdOn`, and `comments`.
- A `printMetaData()` method, included within the constructor, that displays the author and creation date.
- An `addComment()` method, added via `prototype`, to allow adding comments to a blog post.
- Example of creating a new `BlogPost` object and adding a comment using the `addComment()` method.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript constructor functions, the use of prototypes to extend object functionality, and array manipulation for managing blog post comments. The `BlogPost` constructor allows users to create posts with metadata and add comments dynamically.
