# Promise Chain BlogPost Example

## Concepts Covered

- JavaScript Promises and Asynchronous Programming
- File System Operations with `fs/promises` Module
- Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript Classes
- Regular Expressions for Input Validation
- HTML Generation and Styling

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how to use Promises to handle asynchronous operations, including chaining multiple `.then()` calls.
2. Learn how to read and write files using the `fs/promises` module.
3. Develop skills in implementing classes that encapsulate data and methods, ensuring input validation.
4. Practice dynamically generating HTML content from JavaScript objects, applying CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Asynchronous File Handling**: Reads data from a JSON file, processes it, and writes the output to an HTML file using Promises.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes a `BlogPost` class to represent a blog post with properties like `title`, `text`, `author`, and `createdOn`.
- **Dynamic HTML Generation**: Generates a complete HTML document based on the data from the `BlogPost` instance, ensuring consistent formatting and styling.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid data for blog post properties, with meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.
- **CSS Styling**: Applies custom styles to the generated HTML, creating a clean and visually appealing layout.

## Summary

This Promise Chain BlogPost Example project showcases the use of JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading and writing files. It also highlights the benefits of object-oriented programming by using a `BlogPost` class to structure and manage data. By dynamically generating an HTML document, the project demonstrates how to convert data into a presentable format, combining JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This example serves as an excellent foundation for learning about asynchronous programming, file handling, and dynamic web content creation.
